Questions

Iron out the routes


API Endpoints Questions

  Will users see the word api?
  GET /api/users/:id - for user profile pages
  GET /api/followed_users ?
  I will need to be able to return the the followers/followees of a given user, I am not sure if that requires a separate api endpoint

  GET /api/session ?

  I anticipate adding all places myself and not allowing additions. Not sure if this requires a POST API endpoint.

  Places index (to show most reviewed places) / search (to allow users to find places)
  Would listing all places vs. returning search results hit different controller actions?

  Following places?

  GET /api/suggestions
    suggestions index
    needs to be filterable, not sure if that would require another endpoint, or if it is better to fetch all of them and then filter?
    Guidebook-Entries

  I am not sure how best to structure this, this could be totally wrong
  POST /suggestions/:suggestion_id/guidebook_entry/:guidebook_id

Routes Questions

  What about routes that don't match? 404 with search bar?
  Do routes all have #
  Should I mirror the routes + names?
    They call splash landing page /
    They call signup /create
    They call login /login
    They call logged in landing page /home

    Sign Up (redirects to home if logged in)
    login (redirects to home if logged in)
    / (redirects to home if logged in)
    /Home
    /Places   either houses most popular, or redirects there?
      id
      most-popular
    /search (or /places/search?)
    /users/user_id
      suggestions
      guidebooks
        guidebook_id
      followers
      following
      my_places


Components
  Same container for follows/followed
  Do I need an App Container if nothing is shared by all pages?
  Is Header just a component that is included on many pages?
  How to handle the generic feed container that appears in multiple places? (passing in filters)

Redux cycle
  "popular places" vs "places that match the search request"
  Since guidebooks index is always going to be a specific user's guidebooks, I am not sure if it would make sense to include a user_id in the API url?


Some next steps
  Setup login form
  style both forms properly
  header only visible on home route
  sign up for domain
