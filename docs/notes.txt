Questions

Iron out the routes


API Endpoints Questions

  Will users see the word api?
  GET /api/users/:id - for user profile pages
  GET /api/followed_users ?
  I will need to be able to return the the followers/followees of a given user, I am not sure if that requires a separate api endpoint

  GET /api/session ?

  I anticipate adding all places myself and not allowing additions. Not sure if this requires a POST API endpoint.

  Places index (to show most reviewed places) / search (to allow users to find places)
  Would listing all places vs. returning search results hit different controller actions?

  Following places?

  GET /api/suggestions
    suggestions index
    needs to be filterable, not sure if that would require another endpoint, or if it is better to fetch all of them and then filter?
    Guidebook-Entries

  I am not sure how best to structure this, this could be totally wrong
  POST /suggestions/:suggestion_id/guidebook_entry/:guidebook_id

Routes Questions

  What about routes that don't match? 404 with search bar?

    /Places   either houses most popular, or redirects there?
      id
      most-popular
    /users/user_id
      suggestions
      guidebooks
        guidebook_id
      followers
      following
      my_places


  Since guidebooks index is always going to be a specific user's guidebooks, I am not sure if it would make sense to include a user_id in the API url?


Some next steps
  check which pages i should not get into if logged out
  google analytics
  fix suggestion detail view

  Update/delete suggestions
  adjust zoom on map depending on place_type

  icons
    media - guidebook
    wallpaper - guidebook
    border color - pencil writing
    mode edit - pencil also
    photo library - photo lib
    favorite for liking

  sidebars
    most popular countries
    most popular cities
    top users who suggest a place
    related places?
    user profile -> links to most reviewed places, guidebooks, followers, follows
    other cities in the same country sorted by review

    new things to address
      links of usa image in feed

  consider liking of suggestions

For later
  add more styling to login buttons
  save all visible reviews to a guidebook
  nest guidebooks index under user, but guidebooks on its own?
  get icons for major cities ...
Figure out a photo strategy, for checkins, users, places

challenges
follows for random users, not user profile

things missing
  update individual suggestions
  guidebooks -> possibly just a single guidebook?
  aws
  scroll
  suggestions view page
  better sidebars (top users for a place)
  most popular places page? (sidebar top suggesters)
  user profile sidebar (just links to each part)
  most popular cities and states as well

later
  remove error message about minified
  remove logger in production
  explore button
  remove single suggestion view
